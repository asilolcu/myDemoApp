Hello! My name is Taner Furkan GÃ¶ztok and i am a computer science student at TOBB ETU.

This project is for BIL481 Homework 1 and at the same time, it's for understand how to set up a code repository with continuous integration and deployment. I will try to gain experience through working on terminal and making progress with unfamiliar technologies.

I believe that this project (homework) will help me to become a better software engineer.
